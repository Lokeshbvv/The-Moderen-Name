This project is a static desktop-only website for a fictional art gallery named The Modern Frame. It includes four HTML pages: Home, Gallery, About, and Contact â€” all styled using only HTML and CSS. The site features a fixed navigation menu, artwork gallery with images, artist bios, and studio contact details.
CSS Grid and Flexbox are used for layout, along with transitions, animations, and a responsive design for desktop view. Multimedia elements like images, video, and tables enhance the visual experience without using any JavaScript.
